## andre.py
andre.py was made fueled by hybris and alcohol.
 It utilizes the "csv" module to read smaple data which seems not very beneficial in retrospect.

## "andre\_2.0.py"
This was made with my original plan in mind. Basically te file is read by ".readlines()"
Then readlnes is parsed with nested ".strip()" and ".split()" commands.
The parsed file is then read into two lists. These lists are plotted using matplotib.
